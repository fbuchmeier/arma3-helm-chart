# arma-3 Kubernetes Deployment

## Using Headless Clients

Headless clients (as of now `hc`) can be added by setting
`headlessclient.replicas` to a non-zero value.

When using the built in HCs, set `config.headlessClients[0]` to `127.0.0.1`. HCs
created by this chart will connect through a tunnel (envoy proxy) running next
to the server deployment. The reason for this is that ARMA 3 does not allow
whitelisting CIDR ranges for headless clients and in a dynamic environment like 
Kubernetes the IP of a headless client is not known beforehand.

NOTE: Make sure that the tunnel service is not accessible from the internet
(default: `ClusterIP`) as this would allow anyone with the server password to
connect their own HC.

There are different storage approaches you can take for the headless clients,
each with it's on pros and cons:

### Server and Headless Clients sharing the same ReadWriteMany Filesystem

This can be achieved by setting:

- `persistence.headlessclient.sharedFilesystem` to `true`
- `persistence.server.accessMode` to `ReadWriteMany`

Any settings under the `rsync` key will be ignored and rsync will be disabled on
both the server and the hc.

This will provision a single PVC and PV that is shared between the server and
_all_ headless clients.

NOTE: The headless clients will restart (Crashloop) until all the inital game
data has been downloaded by the server. They currently do not wait for the
installation to complete before trying to start up.

Pros:

- easy configuration
- requires only one set of data and thus saves storage

Cons:

- requires a storage driver that supports ReadWriteMany volumes
- initial installation, downloading of huge mods or upgrades may require more
  time, as the data will be streamed to the server and then to the remote
  filesystem.
- slower startup of the server as the network file system used for RWX access is
  not as fast as a local disk

In our tests using Longhorn (NFS) for RWX in a Lab environment (1GBit/s network)
and with around 50GB of mods, this approach was not stable due to the high
network demands.

### Server with a dedicated RWO volume and HCs with a single RWX volume

This can be achieved by setting:

- `persistence.server.accessMode` to `ReadWriteOnce`
- `persistence.headlessclient.accessMode` to `ReadWriteMany`
- `persistence.headlessclient.sharedFilesystem` to `false`
- `rsync.enabled` to `true`

This will provision a single PVC and PV with RWO for the server with
fast and local storage and another PVC and PV pair for the headless clients with
network storage (e.g. NFS). The server will initially download any game data,
mods and updates and once it has finished, the first headless client will start
up, connect to the rsyncd running in the server pod and download any new or
updated data to the headless clients PVC. Once this is finished, the remaining
hcs will start up automatically.

Pros:

- fast server startup as the server files are locally on NVMe disks.
- no network bottleneck
- only twice the amount of storage required in comparison to the last method

Cons:

- requires twice the storage in comparison to using a single RWX volume
- headless clients take some time to sync the data on initial installation or
  major updates, depending on the speed of the network

This approach worked well in our home lab and reduced the load on the network
significantly.

### Server and each HC have their own dedicated RWO volume (Not yet implemented)

In this approach, each component has its own dedicated and local RWO volume. The
server uses a predefined PVC and PV pair, the headless client a volume claim
template which provisions new volumes for every replica in the StatefulSet.

This can be achieved by setting:

- `persistence.server.accessMode = ReadWriteOnce`
- `persistence.headlessclient.accessMode = ReadWriteOnce`
- `persistence.headlessclient.sharedFilesystem` to `false`
- `rsync.enabled` to either `true` (recommended) or `false`

Game data can either be downloaded from the internet directly for every
component and replica (when `rsync.enabled = false`) or only once from the
internet (the server, when `rsync.enabled = true`) and then replicated to the
headless clients via rsync on startup.

In the case of for example 50GBs of game data and three (3) headless clients,
the initial installation will:

- download 50GB from the internet on the server pod to the server PV
- either
  - download 50GB from the internet per headless client replica to each headless
    client over the internet
  - or replicate 50GB from the server per headless client over the local network

Setting `rsync.enabled = false` is not recommended in this scenario, unless you
have a really good internet connection.

Pros:

- no network filesystem / RWX capable storage solution is required
- fast file access for all components due to local storage

Cons:

- the amount of required storage increases with the amount of headless clients
  provisioned
- volumes will remain present even after scaling down any headless clients
- initial setup will take quite some time and depends heavily either on your
  internet or local network speed

## Disallowed Configurations

- rsync.enabled = true AND sharedFilesystem = true
- rwo for server, rwo for clients and rsync.enabled = false (clients will have
  no game data)
- rwo for server, rwx for clients and rsync.enabled = false (clients will have
  no game data)
- rwx for server, rwo (server does not benefit from rwx when clients use rwo)
- sharedFilesystem = true AND rwo for server or client (will not work)
- headlessclient.replicas != 0 AND `127.0.0.1` not in config.headlessClients
